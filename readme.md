# Aux

Aux was built to automate and condense the boilerplate necessary to implement Facebook's Flux architecture. Furthermore, it aims to provide a consistent convention for building actions and private methods in Flux stores.

### WARNING: EARLY ALPHA


Breaking changes are quickly coming -- hopefully :) Aux is being used in some of my other projects and those projects will surely influence its development. Immutable JS will be one of the first things added. 

Examples, a conistent API, tests, docs are all forthcoming.
